## Course Description:
In this [(Legacy) Responsive Web Design Certification][course-link], you'll learn the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

First, you'll build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, you'll learn modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a web form.

Finally, you'll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a Twitter card with Flexbox, and a complex blog layout with CSS Grid.

<br>

### This [Developer Certification] represents approximately 300 hours of coursework.
